ZeroDivisionError: division by zero

# Test case 3 - Exception case for invalid matrix input (not a list of lists)
>>> try: matrix_divided([1, 2, 3], 3)
... except Exception as e: print(e)
matrix must be a matrix (list of lists) of integers/floats

# Test case 4 - Exception case for matrix with different row sizes
>>> try: matrix_divided([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5]], 3)
... except Exception as e: print(e)
Each row of the matrix must have the same size

# Test case 5 - Exception case for div not being a number
>>> try: matrix_divided([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]], "3")
... except Exception as e: print(e)
div must be a number
